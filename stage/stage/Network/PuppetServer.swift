/**
 *  @Brief: The server class which manages all clients' connections. The server has two channels: the data channel which uses UDP protocol and the command channel which uses the TCP protocol. All clients share the data channel and the command channel, the tasks of parsing clients' data requests and command requests are designated to the request handler classes.
 *
 *  The configuration of the server concludes the following settings:
 *  serverName  -   The name of the server
 *  passcode - The security code of the server
